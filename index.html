   <p><h1>HTML Day 1</H1></p> 

   <p>Today we started the journey of learning HTML. </p>
   <p><h4> What is HTML </h4> 
       HTML is a <em>markup language</em> that is used to introduce 
       structure to a website. HTML uses <a href="https://www.techopedia.com/definition/7619/html-tag">tags</a> to create elements 
       to tell the browser how to display the content.   </p>

    <p><h4>Origin</h4></p>
    <p> The first version of HTML was written by Tim Berners-Lee in 1993.</p>

       <p> Since then, there have been many different versions of HTML. 
           Currently, HTML5 is the leading version used by developers.</p>

        </p>
        <p> HTML5 was first released in a public-facing form on 22 January 2008.</p> <p>Its goals were to: 
            <ul>
                <li>improve the language with support for the latest multimedia and other new features 
                <li>to keep the language easily readable by humans
                <li> be understood by computers and devices such as web browsers, parsers, etc. 
                <li> avoid XHTML's rigidity 
                <li> to remain backward-compatible with older software.
                </ul> </p>
